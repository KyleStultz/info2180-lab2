  <p class="grey"> Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
	compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop mounted 10 feet high to a backboard at each end of the court, 
	while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</p>
